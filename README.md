# 🧠 Context

To test your intergalactical coding habilities, we brought from a far, far galaxy a unique challenge for coders capable to work with APIs.
We need to obtain some information about the StarWars movies in order to *present* to some of our partners how great the SW Cinematographic Universe is.

- Use the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) API to get the data you need.

## ⚔️ The Challenge

The challenge is far, far simple: you must get the data asked at [You Must](#-you-must) using the SWAPI API and exhibit the results visually the best way you can. You can create a presentation, graphics, Charts or what you feel is the best. 

### 🏁 Requirements

- API Knowlegment
- JAVA Knowlegment

#### 🤟 You Must:

- [ ] Code in Java
- [ ] You must find the characters who appear the most in the SW movies (you can put them in order if you want);
- [ ] Obtain the Planets Size (Area) and order them (bigger to smaller);
- [ ] Verify how many pilots did the Millenium Falcon had and who were they?;
- [ ] Present the results the best way you can

### 🚰 Ideal Flux

- Find characters and movies via the API;
- Get the planets and the Area of ​​each one;
  - :warning: Find the diameter and calculate the area;
- Find the ship;
  - How many pilots drove it;
  - Their respective names;
- Visually represent the data obtained
---

**Essential Operations**

- [ ] Read the documentation;
- [ ] Save the characters, planets and pilots in variables;
- [ ] Save what you find necessary in variables;
- [ ] :warning: display the code output data;
 

## ✔️ Evaluation Criteria

In addition to the requirements raised above, we will look at the following criteria when correcting the challenge:

- If the challenge was fully accomplished;
- Whether the steps were successfully completed;
- If the code is clean and well documented;
- If the code is optimized;
- The form of presentation;
- Concern for the end user;


### :notebook: To-do list

- [x] Fully take the challenge
  - [x] find the characters who appear the most in the SW movies;
  - [ ] Get the Area of the planets and sort from Largest to Smallest;
  - [ ] Check how many people have piloted our dear Millennium Falcon and display their names;
- [ ] Include details of your solution in the README
  - [ ] what was accomplished in the challenge;
  - [ ] instructions on how to check what was fulfilled;
  - [ ] print the images that prove your solutions;
  - [ ] README must be in English;


### You can:
